<h2>PCs</h2>
<p>
    Right now my main cumputer is an old <b>DELL Latittude E6440</b> running <b>Linux Debian 10</b>.
    I also have an early 2015 retina <b>Macbook Pro</b> that works pretty good!.
</p>
<h2>IDE / Text Editors</h2>
<p>
    For enterprise development with .NET, I've been using <b>Visual Studio</b>. For everything else I use 
    <b>Visual Studio Code</b>, with the Cobalt2 Theme by Wes Bos.
