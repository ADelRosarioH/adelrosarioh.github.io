  <b>More about me... </b>I love building computers! I love small computers, big
  computers, tons of computers working as one computer and how to get the most
  out of them. I'm also extremely passionate about developing pretty looking web
  applications with the best and up-to-date technology available. I also like
  philosophy, entrepreneurship, businesses and ecommerce.
</p>
<p>
  I'm a very experienced <b>.NET</b> developer but I also spend most of the time
  writing lots of <b>JavaScript/TypeScript</b> with <b>React</b> or
  <b>Angular</b>. My pet projects are developed using <b>Python</b> or
  <b>NodeJS</b>, but I've also coded in <b>Java</b> and <b>Objective-C</b> for
  mobile app development.
</p>
<p>
  When I'm not coding, I'm hacking some new tech, but most of the time I spend
  time with my friends and family. I also like to cook some random fancy
  recipes.
